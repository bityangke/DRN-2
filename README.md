# DRN

I don't have any time to do this work, so I release the symbol and some operater to help you to do this

some code is borrowed from Deformable Conv repo 

main result on ade20k testing is 0.5635(symbol-v11)-single model 

main result on cityscapes testing is 82.4(symbol-v7) and 82.8(symbol-v13) - single model

operator_cxx contains ohem softmax using in this repo
lib contains some layers using in this repo

If you have question or some advice, email me 'zhuangyq@pku.edu.cn'

The model will release later
